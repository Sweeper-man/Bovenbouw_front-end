        <p>"Like its hero, the wall-climbing, sewer-spelunking, city-hopping Kyle Crane, Dying Light has its ups and downs and is kind of all over the map. 
            Techland, creator of the Dead Island series, takes elements from a number of games—especially the Far Cry series—and mashes them together in its open world first-person zombie shooter. 
            It's an uneven mix, bookended by a slow start and an exasperating finish, not to mention a few troubling performance issues, but in the middle lies a sweet spot that provides hours of satisfying, zombie-stomping fun."<br>

        <p>"It may be squalid and zombie-infested, but Dying Light's city of Harran isn't a depressing wasteland - it's a vibrant, ambitious, open-world playground. 
            Here, buildings are for climbing, the undead are there to be destroyed in creative ways, and there's always something interesting to be discovered nearby. 
            It takes a while for that to become clear, though; at first, you might even think Dying Light is really about running scared from mobs of seemingly unconquerable zombies, who can quickly drain your stamina and wear out your improvised weapons. 
            Don't be fooled."<br>

        <p>"Oh, Dying Light, how I love you. I love the way you let me leap across rooftops and climb tall towers like an acrobat with endless supplies of energy. 
            I love how I can dropkick a zombie and watch its flailing body knock over others like a fleshy bowling ball. 
            I love looking over my shoulder as I run through the darkness, only to see a crowd of undead sprinting towards me, growling hideously and baring their ghastly teeth."<br>
